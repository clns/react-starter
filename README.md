# react-starter

You should open this project in a [Jetbrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) and **make sure you have the [Node.js plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/node-js.html) installed**.

## Get Started

To get started, first [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository, clone your fork and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone <your-fork>
cd react-starter
npm install
```

Then in your IDE open the *npm* toolbar (from a side, similar to the *Project* toolbar) and double click on **start**. This will fire up [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) and you can access the site at <http://localhost:8080>.

That's it!
